# Configuration file for pyflow suite.

# This file only contains a selection of most common options.
# For more information: https://pyflow-wellies.readthedocs.io/latest/configurations/

# -------- Main Suite configuration -------------------------------------------
group: "anemoi_tests"
name: "{USER}"
labels:
  info: Anemoi system-level tests suite, deployed by {USER} for {name}
limits:
  work: 20

# -------- Ecflow server ------------------------------------------------------
ecflow_server:
  hostname: "localhost"
  user: "{USER}"
  deploy_dir: "{HOME}/pyflow/{group}/{name}"

# -------- Global variables ------------------------------------
# this group can be redefined in other config files. The resulting option will be the concatenation of all
# the variables. Be careful with the order of the variables and the order of the configuration files,
# as the variables will be overriden if they have the same name.

 A Tour Through Anemoi
#######################

On this page we present a few entry points to help you get started using
Anemoi. The aim here is to help you begin to make progress quickly,
rather than being an exhaustive guide of every feature in Anemoi. Try to
find the one that best maps onto your use-case and start there, or
progress through these in the order below for a more structured tour
through the Anemoi framework.

*********************************************
 Making predictions with a pre-trained model
*********************************************

If you would like to make predictions with a model that has already been
trained, e.g. AIFS Single 1. See the :ref:`anemoi-inference getting
started guide <anemoi-inference:usage-getting-started>`.

********************************************
 Training a new model through configuration
********************************************

If you would like to train a new model on a sample dataset, making use
of building blocks which already exist in the Anemoi codebase. See the
:ref:`anemoi-training getting started guide
<anemoi-training:usage-getting-started>`.

*****************************************
 Building a dataset to train a new model
*****************************************

If you would like to go beyond training a model with a sample dataset,
e.g. building a new dataset to train a model using new data. See the
:ref:`anemoi-datasets getting started guide
<anemoi-datasets:usage-getting-started>`.

************************
 Contributing use-cases
************************

We would love to make Anemoi even easier for everyone to use. If there
are any use-cases you would like to see covered in the future, please
consider contacting the developers or creating a pull request to the
`anemoi` repository <https://github.com/ecmwf/anemoi>`_.

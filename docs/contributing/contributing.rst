If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, the first step is to
let us know by raising an issue on GitHub using the following steps:

#. Check the existing issues to avoid duplicates.

#. If it's a new issue, create a detailed bug report or feature request
   by filling in the issue template.

#. Use clear, descriptive titles and provide as much relevant
   information as possible.

#. If you have a bug, include the steps to reproduce it.

#. If you have a feature request, describe the use case and expected
   behaviour.

#. If you are interested in solving the issue yourself, assign the issue
   to yourself and follow the steps below.

#. Tag your issue with the appropriate labels to help the community
   identify and triage it effectively. Be sure to follow the
   :ref:`labelling-guidelines`.

For contributing to the development of the Anemoi packages, please

   account. See the `GitHub tutorial
   <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_.

#. Set up the development environment following the instructions in the
   :ref:`setting-up-the-development-environment` section.

#. Create a new branch for your developments, following the
   :ref:`branching-guidelines`.

#. Make your changes and ensure that your changes adhere to the
   :ref:`development-guidelines`.

#. Commit your changes and push your branch to your fork on GitHub.

#. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the original
   repository, set a PR title according to the
   :ref:`pr-title-guidelines` and fill in the Pull Request template.

#. Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on GitHub. If you
   haven't yet signed the CLA for the repository, you will be prompted

   follow the :ref:`code-review-process`.

*********************
 Code Review Process
*********************

The Anemoi packages have a set of automated checks to enforce coding
guidelines. These checks are run via GitHub Actions on every Pull
Request. For security reasons, maintainers must review code changes
before enabling automated checks.

#. Ensure that all the :ref:`development-guidelines` criteria are met
   before submitting a Pull Request, and pay special attention to the
   :ref:`labelling-guidelines`.

#. Request a review from maintainers or other contributors, noting that
   support is on a best-efforts basis.

#. After an initial review, a maintainer will enable automated checks to
   run on the Pull Request.

#. Reviewers may leave feedback or request changes. To confirm that
   feedback has been addressed, ask reviewers to mark their comments as
   resolved.

#. Once approved, the Pull Request will be merged into the appropiate
   branch according to the :ref:`merging-guidelines`

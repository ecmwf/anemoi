Anemoi is an open-source machine learning framework co-developed by
several national meteorological institutions in collaboration with
ECMWF. Details about individual contributors can be found in the
`CONTRIBUTORS.md
<https://github.com/ecmwf/anemoi-docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md>`_ file
in each package. Inspired by the governance structures of other
open-source projects such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, **Anemoi is guided
by the Anemoi Technical Subgroup (ATS)**, a comitte composed of
representatives from each contributing institution. The ATS meets weekly
in what is known as the ATS meeting, which serves as a forum to
coordinate the project's technical direction. During these meetings, we
discuss ongoing development to ensure that the codebase evolves in a way
that meets the needs of all participating organizations. This includes
reviewing major pull requests (PRs), proposals for new features, and any
changes that could introduce breaking behavior or support new use cases.
